Compiler frontend:
- Don't dump the abstract syntax by default, and also add an option to dump to
  standard out.

==================
Compiler frontend:
- Added an option to dump the abstract syntax.
- Check for a UTF-8 aware locale on startup and bail if one is not found.
Grammar:
- Allow nested modules, though modules may only be declared inside each other,
  and not in places like functions or decls.
- Removed prototype sections from module declarations in order to support
  nested modules.  Visibility declarations still to follow.
- Added an ELSE branch to the case expression.
- Removed constants and renamed variables to values, since I realized that's
  what they really are.
Internals:
- Build an abstract syntax tree from the grammar as we parse it.
- Link against Boehm's GC library so I have less memory management crud to
  deal with.
Misc:
- Added a syntax highlighting file for vim.
