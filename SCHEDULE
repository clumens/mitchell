Each section describes the features of the compiler that will be
completed/present at that release, or which actions will be taken at
release time.


preview-3 - type checking
=========================
- working strict non-polymorphic type system
- grammar frozen (exceptions - record access, empty lists)
- tagged as PREVIEW_3

preview-4 - miscellaneous fixes
===============================
- fix miscellaneous grammar problems - decl, escapes in strings,
  visibility declarations
- add column numbers to error messages
- detect infinite loops of recursive types
- documentation and testing
- tagged as PREVIEW_4
- branch BRANCH_EXCEPTIONS for adding exception support
- branch BRANCH_EXPLICIT_POLY for adding an explicit polymorphic type
  checker

preview-5 - intermediate representation
=======================================
- conversion of AST into simplified AST
- conversion of simplified AST into IR
- merge in BRANCH_EXN
- front-end frozen (exception - serious bugs)
- tagged as PREVIEW_5
? possible branch BRANCH_SSA for development of an SSA-based optimizer

preview-6 - runtime / interpreter
=================================
- on-disk module format
- initial basic runtime library - magic C library module, other important bits
- runtime documentation and testing
- interpreter
- front-end frozen (exception - serious bugs)
- tagged as PREVIEW_6

preview-7 - miscellaneous fixes
===============================
- builtin release for bug fixes and miscellaneous additions, may be
  removed if unneeded
? possible speed profiling and improvements, if needed
- tagged as PREVIEW_7

preview-8 - compiler
====================
- instruction selection and register allocation targeting i386
- compiler front-end
- front-end and IR frozen (exception - serious bugs)
- complete basic runtime library consisting of C and mitchell components
- runtime documentation and testing
- latest time to merge BRANCH_EXPLICIT_POLY since the polymorphic type
  checker will be required for a complete runtime later on
- tagged as PREVIEW_8

bootstrap-1
===========
- bug fixes from post-preview-8
- complete C-based compiler
- complete base runtime
? latest time to merge BRANCH_SSA, if created
- full language specification and compiler & runtime documentation
- full test suite for compiler and runtime
- tagged as BOOTSTRAP_1


future
======
- bootstrap releases follow roughly the same schedule as the preview
  releases, but consist of rewriting mitchell compiler chunks in mitchell
  itself
- bootstrap releases may include additions to the runtime library as
  needed for ease of rewriting the compiler
- bootstrap releases may rarely include changes to the language
  specification but only if needed
- release-1 corresponds with a fully self-hosting mitchell compiler,
  runtime environment, and stabilized specification
- post-release-1 releases will focus on performance of the compiler and
  building up a good optimizer
