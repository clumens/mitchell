General Rules
=============
- Each test case should test exactly one feature or bug.
- The test case should be given a simple but descriptive name - either for
  what piece of the language it tests or for a bug - followed by a three
  digit number.  This number means that several test cases may be written
  for each feature/bug.
- Remember to write test cases that are expected to fail as well as ones
  that are expected to pass.
- The test case must include some special purpose comments at the beginning,
  discussed below.
- When a bug is found, try to write a test case as soon as it is fixed and
  add it to the suite so we can make sure it doesn't come up again in the
  future.

Test Case Comments
==================
Each test case must include a number of special comments right off.  These
comments are used by the test suite controller to know what to expect,
report results, etc.  In addition, there are a number of optional and
case-specific other comments.

The following are required:

- Description - one line of free text describing exactly what the case tests
- Expected - PASS or FAIL

The following may be required:

- HowFail - If the test is expected to FAIL, this comment is required and is
  expected to be some output from the compiler.  The intent here is that we
  can verify that the test is failing in the way it should.

The following are optional:

- Disabled - If present, this comment indicates the test is currently not run.
- Options - Options to pass to the compiler
- Requires - The compiler version required to use this test.
