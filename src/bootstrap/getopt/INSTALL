REQUIREMENTS

This project uses the SML/NJ compilation manager (CM), available in SML/NJ
version 110.40 or newer.  Besides functions from the Basis library, GetOpt,
from smlnj-lib, is needed.


BUILDING

I haven't figured out a good way to get CM to play with the rest of Unix, so
building and installing is still a strangely interactive process.

To build, use the provided .cm file:

sml -m getopt.cm

This will start an interactive SML session, from which you can run the
stabilize command to generate a single heap image for the library

CM.stabilize true "getopt.cm";


INSTALLING

Stabilize the library will result in a file .cm/<heap-suffix>/getopt.cm.
Install this file with your SML libraries as 
<library path>/getopt.cm/.cm/<heap-suffix>/getopt.cm.

Add either to your CM_PATHCONFIG or CM_LOCAL_PATHCONFIG the line

getopt.cm <path to getopt.cm>

You can now use the extended GetOpt structure by adding $/getopt.cm to your CM
sources.
