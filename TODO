- documentation:
   - lots and lots of documentation explaining syntax definition
   - add doxygen docs to all the source
   - explain the somewhat complicated scoping rules
- grammar:
   - visibility declarations (are these really needed?)
   - Mike still doesn't like the word "decl"
- misc:
   - need to think up a format for built modules that will allow us to
     suck in a symbol table for them during semantic analysis
   - proposal for C interface module (to make the runtime possible)
   - outline contents for runtime library (long-term project)
- output:
   - parser error messages can always be better (context, replacements, etc)
- symbol table:
   - functions need to store a list of the types of their formal
     parameters
- testing:
   - more test cases for parser
   - more test cases for scope
