- documentation:
   - lots and lots of documentation explaining syntax definition
   - add doxygen docs to all the source
- output:
   - parser error messages can always be better
   - all error messages should have the same form
   - make fwgetc errors more helpful and descriptive
- testing:
   - more test cases for parser
- grammar:
   - modules should be able to contain other modules
   - types should be fully described in the proto-lst of a module, just
     like everything else is
- misc:
   - check for UTF-8 locale and fail if not found
