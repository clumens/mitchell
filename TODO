- documentation:
   - lots and lots of documentation explaining syntax definition
   - add doxygen docs to all the source
   - explain the somewhat complicated scoping rules
- grammar:
   - visibility declarations (are these really needed?)
   - remove DECL from module-decl (post-preview-3)
   - provide an escape mechanism for strings - way to insert literal
     double quotes, tabs, escapes for colors, etc. (post-preview-3)
- misc:
   - need to think up a format for built modules that will allow us to
     suck in a symbol table for them during semantic analysis
   - proposal for C interface module (to make the runtime possible)
   - outline contents for runtime library (long-term project)
- output:
   - parser error messages can always be better (context, replacements, etc)
   - add column numbers to everything for better error reporting
   - audit line number assignments in absyn to make sure they're right
- symbol table / type checker:
   - detect infinite loops of types
- testing:
   - more test cases for parser
   - more test cases for scope
