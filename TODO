- documentation:
   - polish grammar to a blinding finish
   - add doxygen docs to all the source
- output:
   - internal deugging output framework (various levels of verbosity)
   - parser error messages can always be better
- testing:
   - comprehensive test cases for parser
- grammar:
   - record variable declarations should use braces, just like access does
   - empty expressions in decl..in..end should not be allowed (check for
     this elsewhere too)
