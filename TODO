- documentation:
   - lots and lots of documentation explaining syntax definition
   - add doxygen docs to all the source
   - explain the somewhat complicated scoping rules
- grammar:
   - visibility declarations (are these really needed?)
   - Mike still doesn't like the word "decl"
- misc:
   - need to think up a format for built modules that will allow us to
     suck in a symbol table for them during semantic analysis
- output:
   - parser error messages can always be better
   - all error messages should have the same form
- symbol table:
   - functions need to store a list of the types of their formal
     parameters
   - option to dump symbol table upon leaving a scope (additionally,
     providing the name of what's being left would be helpful)
- testing:
   - more test cases for parser
   - test cases for scope, access of identifiers from modules, etc.
