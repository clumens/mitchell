- documentation:
   - lots and lots of documentation explaining syntax definition
- grammar:
   - allow empty lists
   - remove DECL from module-decl (preview-4)
   - are visibility declarations really needed?
- misc:
   - need to think up a format for built modules that will allow us to
     suck in a symbol table for them during semantic analysis (preview-5)
   - proposal for C interface module
   - outline contents for runtime library
- output:
   - audit line number assignments in absyn to make sure they're right
     (preview-4)
   - debug option for dumping type-annotated AST (preview-4)
   - parser error messages can always be better (context, replacements, etc)
- symbol table / type checker:
   - detect infinite loops of types (preview-4)
   - base types may currently be overridden - good or bad?
   - better hashing function
   - check for duplicate literals in case-expr (if we're not already doing
     this - or, just say the first match wins)
- testing:
   - more test cases for parser
   - more test cases for scope
