- desugar:
   - output option for simplified AST separate from -Idump-absyn
- documentation:
   - documentation aimed more at actual users
   - write a formal semantics
   - think about a better documentation format
- grammar:
   - allow empty lists (requires polymorphic type checking)
   - are visibility declarations really needed?
- misc:
   - need to think up a format for built modules that will allow us to
     suck in a symbol table for them during semantic analysis (preview-5)
   - proposal for C interface module
   - outline contents for runtime library
- output:
   - debug option for dumping type-annotated AST
   - parser error messages can always be better (context, replacements, etc)
- symbol table / type checker:
- testing:
