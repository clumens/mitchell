- documentation:
   - lots and lots of documentation explaining syntax definition
- grammar:
   - allow empty lists (preview-3)
   - come up with something besides a "." to separate records from their
     elements when accessing (preview-3)
   - remove DECL from module-decl (preview-4)
   - provide an escape mechanism for strings - way to insert literal
     double quotes, tabs, escapes for colors, etc. (preview-4)
   - are visibility declarations really needed?
- misc:
   - need to think up a format for built modules that will allow us to
     suck in a symbol table for them during semantic analysis (preview-5)
   - proposal for C interface module
   - outline contents for runtime library
- output:
   - add column numbers to everything for better error reporting
     (preview-4)
   - audit line number assignments in absyn to make sure they're right
     (preview-4)
   - parser error messages can always be better (context, replacements, etc)
- symbol table / type checker:
   - detect infinite loops of types (preview-4)
   - base types may currently be overridden - good or bad?
- testing:
   - more test cases for parser
   - more test cases for scope
